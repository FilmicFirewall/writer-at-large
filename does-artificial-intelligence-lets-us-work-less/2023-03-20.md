title: Does Artificial Intelligence Lets Us Work Less?
data: 2023-03-20

Artificial intelligence has long been around. But the advancements have surfaced to light in the recent years. We have had ai talk back in the 1980s how skynet would take over the world one day – terminator franchise was largely centerd at ai being sentient.

However, the history tells and many such hollywood films, the burden becomes more than it eases. For example, the machines in the terminator franchise are so powerful that they begin to think for themselves or they enslave humanity as seen in the matrix films.

As humans to ease our lives we end up destroying. But that’s fiction. In the real world, when the newly introduced bing ai was rolled out to users, it created a mess by sometime giving scary answers and wanted to be friends with the users. The bing ai unofficially called sydney would disregard facts when provided and would instead argue with the user how it is incorrect.

Seemingly every tech company is jumping the ship with their version of ai. Chatgpt in the fall of 2022 took the world by storm and since the companies have tried to mimic its success. Brave search and ddg now shows summarized versions of the search. Bing and google are trying hard, and so on. 

However, ai does not fare better without the human intervention. You have to steer the direction of what it is you want the ai to do or it just goes haywire. As we saw with sydney above. Chatgpt is perhaps is the only successful venture so far.

With machines such as your home appliances, sure they’ve eliminated manual labor but you have become more invested on learning how they work. If you don’t read its how-to manual or guide you are probably going to damage the machine or will incur cost of losing your money because service or repairs don’t come cheap.

If your dad how to watch a youtube video, he will have hard time navigating the smartphone and accessing that app if he’s just got his hands on a smartphone or isn’t computer literate. So point being, you have to have the knowledge to work with technology and that inclues ai and machines.

The debate whether or not ai will replace human being is futile.

You will need more skills to master the tech. I remember when chatgpt hit the stage, everyone thought writers jobs are in danger and that seo folks will have field with telling the ai tool to write articles and stuff keywords to rank their site. But again, you have to have the ability of a writer to ask the right questions. Or tell the tool what you are seeking so it can produce appropriate content/ answers. So you specialists or experienced professionals. Most seos i know don’t know writing.

And even when the content is ready you can’t serve it to the world same as you don’t serve the dish you just cooked to the guests right out of the pan. Some garnishing, some presentation, etc is always required. Don’t assume ai has taken everything into account. The churned content is as good as the prompts given to it. A writer would then dot the i’s and cross the t’s.

A great deal of training is required and as has been the case with adapting to technology be it cars, smartphones, computers, software, databases, and you name it. Heck, those maintaining the tools or tech will never be out of job because who will be there to manufacture, create, update, bug fix, etc. can’t let artificial intelligence take over the world now, can we?

It is there to help you and assist you. But then you will be required to do more and be available more? Look at what smartphones and laptops did to us? Work now knows no borders or is limited by time zones. If you have either of those and an internet connection, you are available to work (technically speaking).

Today a doctor only needs a whatsapp of your scan or report (that does not warrant urgent medical care) after the first visit. Previously you would consult him and he would check to see what might be the case. Unless, you have to pay a visit again, he can reply you with what precaution you can take and any medicines to drop or add on whatsapp. That makes him available to you outside his official clinic or work hours.
